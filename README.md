## 🌟 What Makes This Special

This tool makes stamp identification easy through **visual pattern matching** in a responsive, searchable card grid. Instead of flipping through catalogues:

- **Browse 3,470+ stamps** in a responsive grid that works on every device
- **Filter by decade** with a scrollable pill bar — instantly jump to any era
- **Smart search** across topics, years, colours, denominations, and historical notes
- **Tap for details** — get ID, denomination, category, colour, and historical context
- **Lazy-loaded images** with visual placeholders — fast on any connection

## 🚀 Try It Now

**👆 [Launch the Stamp Identifier](https://adrianspeyer.github.io/canadian-stamp-identifier)**

No installation needed — works in any modern web browser. Works offline after first visit.

## ✨ Features

### Search & Filter
- **Instant search**: type a year, topic, colour, or keyword — searches notes too
- **Decade filtering**: scrollable pill bar with stamp counts per era
- **Combined filtering**: search within a decade (e.g., "beaver" in the 1850s)
- **Debounced input**: responsive even with 3,470+ stamps

### Visual Interface
- **Responsive card grid**: 2 columns on phones → 10+ on ultrawide
- **Shimmer loading**: coloured decade placeholders with animated shimmer while images load
- **Three card states**: loading (shimmer), loaded (fade-in), error ("Image unavailable")
- **Decade navigation**: chevron arrows with active pill auto-scroll
- **Scroll-to-top**: quick return button after scrolling

### Cross-Platform
- **Phone**: 2–3 column grid, touch-friendly, sticky search
- **Tablet**: 4–6 columns, timeout-protected image loading
- **Desktop**: 8–10+ columns, hover effects, keyboard navigation
- **One codebase**: no separate mobile/desktop views

### Performance
- **Service worker**: caches app files and up to 500 recently viewed images
- **Concurrency queue**: max 6 simultaneous image loads with 15s timeout
- **Queue flush on filter**: switching decades immediately prioritises visible stamps
- **localStorage cache**: stamps.json cached locally for instant repeat visits
- **Session persistence**: decade and search filters survive page refresh
- **JSON preload**: browser starts fetching data before JS parses

### Bilingual (EN / FR)
- **Language toggle** in the header — switches instantly between English and French
- **Complete French UI**: all buttons, labels, filters, panels, and error states
- **Automatic category translation**: all 15 categories and 100+ subcategories translate via lookup
- **Colour translation**: all philatelic colour terms translate automatically
- **French stamp data**: `stamps-fr.json` provides translated mainTopics and notes (incremental — falls back to English for untranslated stamps)
- **Persistent**: language preference saved in localStorage

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigable (Tab + Enter/Space)
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Focus-visible outlines

### Security
- Content Security Policy restricting all sources
- No inline event handlers
- All data via `createElement` + `textContent`
- Zero third-party JavaScript

## 📋 JSON Format Reference

Each stamp in `data/stamps.json` has this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "001",
  "year": 1851,
  "mainTopic": "Beaver",
  "subTopic": "Nature & Wildlife: Animals",
  "denomination": "3d",
  "color": "red",
  "image": "images/1850s/001-beaver-3d-1851.jpg",
  "notes": "Canada's first stamp, depicting a beaver. Imperforate. Printed by Rawdon, Wright, Hatch & Edson."
}
```

| Field | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Proprietary reference number (see [Note on IDs](#-note-on-ids)) | Yes |
| `year` | Year of issue | Yes |
| `mainTopic` | Primary subject/design description | Yes |
| `subTopic` | Category in `Category: Subcategory` format (see [Category Reference](#-category-reference)) | Yes |
| `denomination` | Face value (e.g., `3d`, `5¢`, `PERMANENT™ (P). Current monetary value: $1.24 .`) | Yes |
| `color` | Dominant colour(s) (e.g., `red`, `blue and green`, `multicoloured`) | Yes |
| `image` | Path to image file in `images/[decade]/` | Yes |
| `notes` | Historical context, series info, notable varieties. 1–3 sentences. | Yes |

### Notes Guidelines
- Keep to 1–3 sentences
- Include historical context: what was the occasion, what series is it part of
- Mention notable varieties or errors where known (e.g., "A variety exists with inverted centre")
- Use Canadian English (colour, honour, catalogue)
- **Never include Scott catalogue numbers** (licensing restriction)
- Cross-reference other stamps using proprietary IDs: "See also #140 and #868"

## 🔢 Note on IDs

The stamp IDs in this project (`#001`, `#002`, etc.) are **proprietary reference numbers** created specifically for this tool. They are **not** Scott catalogue numbers or any other licensed numbering system.

For varieties, errors, and detailed pricing, cross-reference the **year**, **topic**, and **denomination** in official stamp catalogues.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES2020+) — zero dependencies
- **Data**: JSON catalogue, Git version controlled
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with global CDN
- **Caching**: Service worker + localStorage + browser HTTP cache

### Performance Strategy
| Layer | Technique |
|---|---|
| Rendering | Batched at 250 cards/frame with progress bar |
| Off-screen | `content-visibility: auto` skips rendering hidden cards |
| Image loading | IntersectionObserver → concurrency queue (max 6, 15s timeout) |
| Image decode | `decoding="async"` — off main thread |
| Filtering | Show/hide existing DOM (no recreation), queue flush on filter change |
| Data | localStorage cache, `<link rel="preload">` hint |
| Repeat visits | Service worker: cache-first for images, network-first for data |
| Search | 180ms debounce, indexes all fields including notes |

### Security
- Content Security Policy via `<meta>` tag (`script-src 'self'`, `img-src 'self' data:`, etc.)
- `no-referrer` policy
- All stamp data rendered via `createElement` + `textContent` (zero `innerHTML` with data)
- Zero inline event handlers
- Service worker scoped to same origin
