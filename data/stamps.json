New Brunswick separated from Nova Scotia in 1784. The issue went on sale on the 16th August, 1934, to coincide with celebrations which took place in New Brunswick in commemoration of the sesquincentennial anniversary. When the stamps were required, no impression of the original seal could be found. As the only copy available in Ottawa was derived from the seal granted by Queen Victoria. It was used in designing the same as the original Great Seal of King George III. Great Seal of the Province of New Brunswick. The original seal is believed to be no longer in existence. With letters patent dated 21st February, 1785, it was forwarded to Thomas Carleton, Governor of the colony, from the Court of St. James. The basic design on the obverse was the same on all great seals granted the colony by succeeding monarchs on their accession to the throne. A description follows: \"A representation of a ship sailing up a river, on the borders of which is a new settlement with lofty pines on each side, destined to Naval purposes....\" The Latin inscription, SIGILL PROVINCIA NOV\" BRUNS, means, \"Seal of the Province of New Brunswick.\" The motto, SPEM REDUXIT, \"It brings back hope,\" relates to the circumstances involved in the establishment of the colony. | Issue: August 16, 1934 | Qty: 5,050,000 | Perf/Dim: 11 | Printer: British American Bank Note Company."

      "notes": "Desc: Stephen Butler Leacock, a renowned humorist, historian and economist whose writings brought him international fame, came with his parents to the pioneer farm lands of Ontario some seven years after his birth on the 30th December 1869 in Hampshire, England. His humour shines through in later references to his birthplace as Swanmoor, a hamlet and parish on Waltham Chase, Hampshire; \"it doesn't say who chased whom\". Leacock, one of a family of 11, died on the 28th March 1944 in Toronto where he spent eighteen years commencing with five years as a student at Upper Canada College; he took his B.A. at Toronto in 1891 and Ph.D. at Chicago in 1903 after having been, in his words, \"examined for the last time and pronounced completely full\". He was appointed the first lecturer of political science at Montreal's McGill, where the Redpath Library has a comprehensive collection of his books and manuscripts; prior to a memorable thirty-two years at McGill he served ten and one half years as a school teacher. A further comprehensive collection of his works exists in his former summer house at Orillia, Ontario, recently declared a National Historic Site, which has been preserved for more than ten years as a Memorial Home and Literary Shrine. The Literary characters created by Leacock carried the unmistakable imprint of the author. As an example of his geographic descriptions; everyone's small home town is epitomized in the Mariposa of \"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town\", a book widely regarded as typical of Leacock's style. As an author he referred to his own \"liquified loquacity\" and the \"general corrective of the humorous point of view\". \"The half truth\", he is reported to have said, \"is to me the mellow moonlight in which I love to dwell\". Indicative of his point view was a pronouncement that he would rather have written Alice In Wonderland than the entire Encyclopedia Britannica. At one point in his career Leacock is said to have facetiously stated he was abandoning public lecturing because of a need to learn the Chinese language to gain a new audience; it is significant that ultimately many of his works, some sixty in all, were translated throughout the world. An unfinished autobiography \"The Boy I Left Behind Me\", published posthumously in 1946, provides a remarkable insight into Leacock's recollections of his family life, his pioneer farm home some four miles from the south shore of Lake Simcoe in Ontario, and his transatlantic voyage to the new world aboard what he described as a grand old vessel combining steam with towering masts, a maze of ropes and a cloud of canvas. Of the final thirty miles of his journey in a horse drawn wagon he provides vivid descriptions of travel over corduroy log roads and through the thick swamps which were invariably the lot of pioneer farm settlers. Of his early school days, Leacock said it was a combination of thistles and caste which prevented him from being a barefoot boy at the \"Little Red School house\". | Issue: November 12, 1969 | Qty: 35,500,000 | Perf/Dim: 12 x 12.5 | Printer: British American Bank Note Company."

      "notes": "Desc: Henry Kelsey, credited with being the first white man to travel the vast western plains of Canada, accomplished his purpose because of a facility to identify with the native Indians, to travel and live with them and to endure on equal terms. Although time has led to the acceptance of Kelsey as a trail-blazing explorer of Canada, he did not look upon himself as such. True to the conditions of his employment with the Company to which he had been apprenticed, Kelsey considered himself only as an agent to open new avenues of trade. Fragmentary documentation for years inhibited his acceptance as a true explorer of Canada. Even after his death in England in the 1720's there were determined attacks on the Hudson's Bay Company questioning the rights granted in the famous Charter of 1670 and charging that the obligation to explore had not been fulfilled. Suggestions were made that Kelsey, instead of being despatched by the Company from their Post on the Bay, has, as an impulsive twenty-year-old, rebelled and run away to travel aimlessly with the Indians. Prominent in the agitation against the Company was Arthur Dobbs who, in 1754, left his ancestral castle in Northern Ireland to become Governor of North Carolina. Eventually, in 1926, during cleaning operations in the Dobb's Castle library in Ireland, papers of great historic significance were uncovered, and, with an immediate acceptance of their value, turned over to the Public Records Office in Belfast. These documents, 128 handwritten pages by Kelsey, jointly published as \"The Kelsey Papers\" by the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland and the Public Archives of Canada, did much to dispel all doubts. They were a meticulously written record kept by Kelsey, some describing his far-reaching travels into areas of Canada's West where no white man had previously trod. The care with which he had provided detailed descriptions of the varying vegetation and geographical features permitted little doubt in the validity of claims regarding his journeys. Confirming earlier beliefs in his achievements, these papers contained a first hand record of human courage and endurance. There was now detailed recorded experience from a white man who had been the first to live and travel on the prairies, and the first to see the immense Buffalo herds on those plains. The actual date is uncertain, but it is generally accepted that Kelsey's year of birth was 1670, the year of the granting of a Charter to \"The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's Bay\". There is evidence that he came from humble parentage, however, it is recognize that some person with his welfare in mind had provided him with an education above average for a boy of that era. His facility in acquiring new languages and his grasp of mathematics in learning navigation are recognized as requiring an educational base not possessed by an untrained waif of the streets. At the estimated age of 14, in 1684, he was apprenticed to the Company. Embarking on the \"Lucy\" on England's Thames River in the same year, he sailed for Hudson Bay and into a period of forty years of life during which he was to earn lasting fame in Canada's history. | Issue: April 15, 1970 | Qty: 36,450,000 | Perf/Dim: 12 x 12.5 | Printer: British American Bank Note Company."

      "notes": "Desc: Figure skating, the drawing of figures on ice, is one of the most scientific and artistic of sports. It is also the most difficult, requiring skill in plain skating, a high degree of body control and assiduous practice. Skating, which dates back to at least the 8th century, was at first simply a means of moving easily and quickly over ice. The earliest known skated consisted of bone runners laced to the feet with thongs. Skates with steel blades fixed in wooden soles were probably used in the Netherlands around 1250. This was the start of skating as we know it. The history of skating can be loosely traced by casual references to it in literature. In the 12th century, for example, William Fitzstephens in his \"Description of the City of London\" describes young men who \"tye bones to their feete and under their heels, and shoving themselves with a little picked staffe doe slide swiftlie as a bird flyeth in the air or an arrow out of a crossbow.\" Skating is widely recorded in art as well. A woodcut by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, dated 1448, illustrates the skating accident which befell St. Lidwina, patron saint of skaters, in 1396. Until the middle of the 19th century, the \"English\" style of skating, which was staid, rigid and precise, was predominant. But in 1864, Jackson Haines, originally a dancing master, exploited his ballet training to the full and stunned Europe by the beauty and flowing ease of his skating movements. Thus was the International style born. Louis Rubenstein, the Canadian who won the first international skating competition in 1890 in St. Petersburg, Russia, was the first president of the Amateur Skating Association of Canada, which later became the Canadian Figure Skating Association. In 1947 the Association was elected to the International Skating Union. In 1905 the first Canadian National Championships were held, and in 1924 Canada was represented for the first time in World and Olympic Championships. Although Canadian skaters gave creditable performances from the beginning, it wasn't until 1947 that Canada won a world championship. In that year, and again in 1948, Barbara Ann Scott won the Ladies World Championship. This was the first time a world figure skating championship left Europe. Top honours have gone to several other Canadians: in pairs competition, Frances Dafoe and Norris Bowden, Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul, and Maria and Otto Jelinek have all won one or more world championships; Donald Jackson, Donald McPherson and Petra Burka have all been world champions in singles events. Any country that is a member of the International Skating Union is entitled to entre one skater, or pair of skaters, in each category. If in the previous year's competition a country placed in the top ten, it is then permitted two competitors in that event. A place in the top five allows the successful skater to enter again along with two countrymen. Canada, then, is this year entitled to entre three skaters in the ladies singles event, one in the men singles, two pairs and one dance couple. Calgary, which is hosting the 1972 World Championship from March 6 to 12, is the third Canadian city to be so honoured. In 1932 the championships were held in Montreal and in 1960 in Vancouver. | Issue: March  1, 1972 | Qty: 25,300,000 | Perf/Dim: 12 | Printer: Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited."

      "notes": "Desc: The Subarctic cultural area extended from the Labrador coast, through Quebec, northern Ontario and the northern prairies across the Mackenzie River basin and into Alaska. Living in this vast region were Indians of two language groups, the Athapaskan, distantly related to certain Asian languages, and the Algonkian. The Athapaskans were the western group and included Kutchin, Hare, Dogrib, Yellowknife, Kaska, Slave, Skani, Beaver and Chipewyan Indians. The Algonkians included Ojibwas, Crees, Mistassini-Crees, Montagnais, Naskapis and Beothuks. The Beothuks are extinct. In the harsh Subarctic, where food was scarce, people were widely scattered. During winter they hunted, in groups of around twenty relations, in their own isolated territories. When summer arrived, the hunting parties which formed a single band came together, often at a good fishing spot or a trading post. A senior male led this band. He was usually an outstanding hunter and a skillful bargainer or perhaps a noted shaman. Generally, the leader had more influence than power. With no police courts, jails or other civil and religious institutions to control the Subarctic Indians, they relied on anxiety to regulate personal conduct. Starvation was the penalty for those who failed in the almost daily task of extracting sustenance from the meagre environment. The people hunted, fished and snared but ate little plant food. Caribou and rabbits were especially important dietary items although there were regional variations. While certain tribes despised fishing, those of the far west depended heavily on the salmon they caught using a trap derived perhaps from the Russians. The Cree of James Bay were expert at taking waterfowl. Yukon hunters jumped out of a canoe onto the back of a swimming moose and cut their throats. The Algonkians and Athapaskans of the north usually boiled their meat but occasionally roasted it. They often dried meat and preserved it in the intestines of large game animals or in bark containers. Some group prepared a version of pemmican animals by breaking up fish flesh, and storing it, to be eaten later with fish oil. There were two meals each day, and food was served in birchbark plates and wooden dishes. The Subarctic Indians ate a large amount because they burned many calories keeping warm and hunting. Housing was light, portable and easily assembled. The most common type was the conical lodge. Foundation poles were simple to find and erect and the light outer shells of bark or skin were easy to carry from one campsite to another. Encampments usually contained two to five dwellings, each of which housed one or more families. The Indians built racks to dry meat, to hold supplies and to set out bones in respect for dead game animals. The northern natives learned to travel in summer and winter, because they often moved. They used canoes especially in the east where many bodies of water crisscrossed the dense forests and the muskeg. Although canoe styles varied from region to region, the birch bark model was ideal since it was light and easy to fit. Water transportation was less common in the west, although in the late 1800's, the mountain Indians invented the mooseskin boat for returning downriver from their winter camps. These craft, some as much as forty feet long and seven feet wide, had a larger carrying capacity than canoes. Mooseskin boats normally drifted with the current although paddles came into play in fast water and at landings. When carrying goods overland, the Indians used a long narrow thong with a wide centre section. They passed the wide part around the porter's forehead and tied the ends to a bundle of up to several hundred pounds which rested on the back. Snowshoes kept people from sinking into the snow in winter and toboggans, pulled by the Indians themselves, moved possessions from place to place across the drifts. Few bands produced sleds. Dogs did not pull either sleds or toboggans until after the Europeans arrived. Men and women cooperated in the manufacture of canoes, mooseskin boats and snowshoes. Men made paddles and frames and women prepared webbings and covers. Religion was intimately connected with the hunt. The Indians wanted to know where the game was and attempted to find out through ceremonial songs and the interpretation of dreams. The tribes were careful to honour and placate the spirits of any animals they had killed. Rituals were minor affairs but shamanism was important. A shaman was an individual who was thought to have supernatural powers for good or evil. The spirit of the turtle was often the shaman's helper. Some Subarctic bands believed in reincarnation. Subarctic Indians were among the first North Americans to meet Europeans. Beothuks probably came into contact with the Vikings and certainly saw John Cabot. He observed the Beothuk's custom of painting their bodies with red ochre and many in the old world assumed from his description of this practice that Indians were red. The newcomers and the natives quickly exchanged technologies thus affecting the lifestyles of both. Europeans could not have survived without the canoe, the snowshoes, and the local remedy for scurvy while metal knives, traps and cooking pots as well as guns made the existence of the natives considerably more comfortable. However, they obtained such items in return for furs and they soon put a greater emphasis on trapping and a smaller emphasis on communal use of the land. Caucasians gave the Subarctic Indians measles and smallpox. Samuel Hearne estimated that the 1781-82 smallpox epidemic killed nine-tenths of the northern Athapaskans. The Europeans do not seem to have received any illnesses in return but made up for this in other parts of the non-white world where they acquired malaria, syphilis and the black death. Ray Webber photographed the artifacts which are, from left to right, a drum, a scorched caribou scapula bone, a mitishi (beaded charm), a woman's hat, a decorated bear skull, a toy bear and a model canoe. The canoe is Chipewyan and the other objects are of Montagnais-Naskapi origin. The Royal Ontario Museum, the National Museums of Canada and Alika Podolinsky-Webber provided the artifacts. The way of life stamp features the \"Dance of the Kutcha-Kutchin\". A.H. Murray drew this scene and M. & N. Hanhart Lithographers originally printed it for a book entitled Arctic Searching Expedition... by Sir John Richardson. The Post Office is reproducing the picture with the permission of the Public Archives of Canada. Lewis Parker sketched a ceremonial costume of the Kutchin tribe for the dress stamp. Georges Beaupré designed the graphic symbolism stamp which includes a Ojibwa thunderbird and a decorative strip from the coat of a Naskapi. Mr. Beaupré did the typography for the entire Indian series. | Issue: April  4, 1975 | Qty: 14,000,000 | Perf/Dim: 13.5 | Printer: Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited."

Foundation poles were simple to find and erect and the light outer shells of bark or skin were easy to carry from one campsite to another. Encampments usually contained two to five dwellings, each of which housed one or more families. The Indians built racks to dry meat, to hold supplies and to set out bones in respect for dead game animals. The northern natives learned to travel in summer and winter, because they often moved. They used canoes especially in the east where many bodies of water crisscrossed the dense forests and the muskeg. Although canoe styles varied from region to region, the birch bark model was ideal since it was light and easy to fit. Water transportation was less common in the west, although in the late 1800's, the mountain Indians invented the mooseskin boat for returning downriver from their winter camps. These craft, some as much as forty feet long and seven feet wide, had a larger carrying capacity than canoes. Mooseskin boats normally drifted with the current although paddles came into play in fast water and at landings. When carrying goods overland, the Indians used a long narrow thong with a wide centre section. They passed the wide part around the porter's forehead and tied the ends to a bundle of up to several hundred pounds which rested on the back. Snowshoes kept people from sinking into the snow in winter and toboggans, pulled by the Indians themselves, moved possessions from place to place across the drifts. Few bands produced sleds. Dogs did not pull either sleds or toboggans until after the Europeans arrived. Men and women cooperated in the manufacture of canoes, mooseskin boats and snowshoes. Men made paddles and frames and women prepared webbings and covers. Religion was intimately connected with the hunt. The Indians wanted to know where the game was and attempted to find out through ceremonial songs and the interpretation of dreams. The tribes were careful to honour and placate the spirits of any animals they had killed. Rituals were minor affairs but shamanism was important. A shaman was an individual who was thought to have supernatural powers for good or evil. The spirit of the turtle was often the shaman's helper. Some Subarctic bands believed in reincarnation. Subarctic Indians were among the first North Americans to meet Europeans. Beothuks probably came into contact with the Vikings and certainly saw John Cabot. He observed the Beothuk's custom of painting their bodies with red ochre and many in the old world assumed from his description of this practice that Indians were red. The newcomers and the natives quickly exchanged technologies thus affecting the lifestyles of both. Europeans could not have survived without the canoe, the snowshoes, and the local remedy for scurvy while metal knives, traps and cooking pots as well as guns made the existence of the natives considerably more comfortable. However, they obtained such items in return for furs and they soon put a greater emphasis on trapping and a smaller emphasis on communal use of the land. Caucasians gave the Subarctic Indians measles and smallpox. Samuel Hearne estimated that the 1781-82 smallpox epidemic killed nine-tenths of the northern Athapaskans. The Europeans do not seem to have received any illnesses in return but made up for this in other parts of the non-white world where they acquired malaria, syphilis and the black death. Ray Webber photographed the artifacts which are, from left to right, a drum, a scorched caribou scapula bone, a mitishi (beaded charm), a woman's hat, a decorated bear skull, a toy bear and a model canoe. The canoe is Chipewyan and the other objects are of Montagnais-Naskapi origin. The Royal Ontario Museum, the National Museums of Canada and Alika Podolinsky-Webber provided the artifacts.

      "notes": "Desc: The Subarctic cultural area extended from the Labrador coast, through Quebec, northern Ontario and the northern prairies across the Mackenzie River basin and into Alaska. Living in this vast region were Indians of two language groups, the Athapaskan, distantly related to certain Asian languages, and the Algonkian. The Athapaskans were the western group and included Kutchin, Hare, Dogrib, Yellowknife, Kaska, Slave, Skani, Beaver and Chipewyan Indians. The Algonkians included Ojibwas, Crees, Mistassini-Crees, Montagnais, Naskapis and Beothuks. The Beothuks are extinct. In the harsh Subarctic, where food was scarce, people were widely scattered. During winter they hunted, in groups of around twenty relations, in their own isolated territories. When summer arrived, the hunting parties which formed a single band came together, often at a good fishing spot or a trading post. A senior male led this band. He was usually an outstanding hunter and a skillful bargainer or perhaps a noted shaman. Generally, the leader had more influence than power. With no police courts, jails or other civil and religious institutions to control the Subarctic Indians, they relied on anxiety to regulate personal conduct. Starvation was the penalty for those who failed in the almost daily task of extracting sustenance from the meagre environment. The people hunted, fished and snared but ate little plant food. Caribou and rabbits were especially important dietary items although there were regional variations. While certain tribes despised fishing, those of the far west depended heavily on the salmon they caught using a trap derived perhaps from the Russians. The Cree of James Bay were expert at taking waterfowl. Yukon hunters jumped out of a canoe onto the back of a swimming moose and cut their throats. The Algonkians and Athapaskans of the north usually boiled their meat but occasionally roasted it. They often dried meat and preserved it in the intestines of large game animals or in bark containers. Some group prepared a version of pemmican animals by breaking up fish flesh, and storing it, to be eaten later with fish oil.

The Roman \"circus\", Latin for \"circle\", was modelled after the Greek hippodrome where spectators gathered in tiers around a central arena to watch chariot races and gladiator fights. The modern circus was created in the 18th-century England by Philip Astley. A retired sergeant major, Astley was a trick horseback rider who discovered that centrifugal force would help keep him standing on a horse's back if he galloped in a circle. Astley applied this discovery to circus shows, and moved displays of horsemanship from a rectangular stage to a ring. Though rope-dancers, acrobats and jugglers were soon added to the modern circus, horsemanship continued to be the focus for over 80 years.",

Rather than a melodious song, the flycatcher is characterized by a raucous call, usually heard high in the tree canopy. Males defend the roost, while the females incubate the eggs - four to eight eggs at a time, for 13 to 15 days. Once the fledglings are hatched, the fathers bring insects and small fruits back to the nest. Beetles, bees, wasps, flies, bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, butterflies, moths and spiders provide the main meals. Like all other flycatcher, they are migrants, wintering in southern Florida, central Mexico, Cuba, northern Columbia and Venezuela. After making the return trip north in early May, great crested flycatchers can be found in southeastern Saskatchewan, southern Manitoba, southern and southwestern Ontario, southwestern Quebec, southwestern New Brunswick and in a limited area of mainland Nova Scotia.",

The first Chinese community in Canada was founded around 1858 at Barkerville, south-east of Prince George, British Columbia - at the time of the Fraser River gold rush. The majority of these immigrants were from Guangdong province, an area between Canton, China and Hong Kong. The next major wave of immigration was in the1880s when 15,000 men were contracted to help build the British Columbia section of the Canadian Pacific Railway. When the transcontinental railway was completed in 1885, many of these men returned to China, while some settled in the Prairie provinces and Eastern Canada. Today, about one million Chinese immigrants live in Canada - two-thirds in Vancouver and Toronto.",

      "notes": "Desc: Aboriginal people have always played significant roles in Canada's history. The spread of the fur trade, for example, and European exploration and settlement would not have been possible without the help of the First Peoples, who were relied upon for their knowledge and experience. One Aboriginal who played a pivotal role in ensuring the survival of French settlement in Eastern Canada was Chief Henri Membertou, Grand Chief of the Mi'kmaq. The French first met Chief Membertou when they landed in the harbour that would later become Port-Royal. At this time, Membertou, who recalled meeting Jacques Cartier in 1534, is thought to have been more than 100 years old. His geniality and stature created a bond between the French and Mi'kmaq that helped to develop and prolong the historically important settlement in Port-Royal. When the French left Port-Royal in 1607, Membertou took care of the fort until their return three years later. Chief Membertou's important role in this era of Canadian history made him a natural choice to be featured on the fourth stamp of Canada Post's five-stamp French Settlement in North America series. | Issue: July 26, 2007 | Qty: 3,000,000 | Perf/Dim: 13 x 12.5 | Printer: Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited."

When Lucy Maud Montgomery completed her first novel in 1905, she received several rejections from publishers, so she put the story away.

Anne of Green Gables was finally published in Boston in 1908, to immediate success. One hundred years later, Anne and her story are featured on a pair of domestic rate (52¢) stamps issued by Canada Post to celebrate the novel's centennial. The stamp images are based on original artwork officially authorized by The heirs of Lucy Maud Montgomery and the Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority Inc. The painting of Anne was created by Ben Stahl, and that of her beloved Green Gables house by Christopher Kovacs. \"Anne is such a unique character, so full of life and so inspired by nature,\" says designer Dennis Page. \"These paintings represent her story well-the images are surrounded by nature, and Anne appears lost in her thoughts.\" | Issue: June 20, 2008 | Qty: 3,350,000 | Perf/Dim: simulated perforation = dentelure simulée, 13+ | Printer: Lowe-Martin Company Inc.."

He was raised in Toronto, where he earned an appointment to the civil service, as a letter carrier, in May, 1882, rare for a black person at the time. Jackson’s white co-workers refused to train him when he first reported for work, and he was forced to take a lower position as a hall porter. Toronto’s black community rallied on Jackson’s behalf. The issue soon came to the attention of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, whose intervention gave Jackson the job he deserved. On June 2, 1882, Jackson began training as a letter carrier. He worked at the post office for 36 years until his death in 1918.",
